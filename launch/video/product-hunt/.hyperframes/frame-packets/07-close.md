- roles: squidagent-logo = cutout · fieldflow-demo = supporting · launchops-demo = supporting · cinder-studio-demo = supporting
- sfx: soft-logo-resolve

Adapt `logo-assemble-lockup`: keep the parts-arrive lockup and long static close; use the three real demo surfaces as the arriving parts rather than invented logo geometry.
Scene 1 (0.0–2.8s): three showcase videos enter as an equal-width triptych, one at a time — FieldFlow, LaunchOps, Cinder Studio — with short outcome labels and no metrics.
Scene 2 (2.8–4.4s): the triptych scales down as the existing Squid mark draws/settles above it; “Plan. Build. Verify. Export.” reveals word-by-word (`dynamic-content-sequencing`).
Scene 3 (4.4–6.0s): `squidagent.app` wipes in below the lockup; all motion resolves to a dead-static mobile-safe hold.

## Selected blueprint: logo-assemble-lockup

# logo-assemble-lockup — Logo Assemble → Lockup

**intent**: A brand mark / wordmark comes to exist on screen and resolves into a centered logo lockup — built from parts (elements assemble or orbit in, letters cascade, an outline draws on, or a camera pushes through negative space), spring-BLOOMED whole from zero on a cleared stage, MORPHED in one unbroken chain out of the preceding phrase / glyph, absorbed from a kinetic streak, or already assembled and settling as decorations clear — optionally extended into a final URL / CTA / end card.

**roles served**

- Product_Intro (from product-intro-logo-system-assemble): A wordless, premium brand STING — an abstract system of elements pulses / grows / orbits and assembles around a FIXED central logo, carried by one cinematic camera tilt; no copy, no UI.
- CTA (from cta-camera-push-lockup): The logo build is a LEAD-IN to the final ask — a 3D mark assembles + wordmark cascades, then a fast camera PUSH-THROUGH the mark's negative space streaks giant CTA letters past the lens and resolves on a `[url]` / `[CTA verb]` lockup.
- CTA (from cta-button-wordmark-build): The "draws-its-own-outline → wordmark-builds-letter-by-letter" sub-shape — a `[CTA button]` pill strokes its own glowing border, a diagonal-band WIPE flips the frame, and the `[wordmark]` types in beside a slash to land the lockup. Camera static.
- Brand_Outro (from brand-outro-assemble-logo-lockup): The closing mark — a formation of `[feature pills / UI elements]` CLEARS the stage off all four edges, then on the empty frame the `[logo mark]` draws itself on stroke-by-stroke and the `[wordmark]` reveals to complete the lockup, then fades out.
- Product_Intro (from brand-reveal-assemble-zoom): a context-then-focus reveal — a companion tagline TYPES out to set context, the hero mark pops in beside it, then the companion exits as the layout recenters and the camera pushes IN to a held close-up on the mark (wide composition narrowing to a tight focus).
- Product_Intro (from logo-parts-lockup-assembly): the literal parts build — `[icon parts]` (a glowing dot traces a circle, semi-circles scale up and overlap, strokes rotate in) converge into the `[brand icon]` center-frame on a flat / gradient field, the `[wordmark]` joins (± a `[badge pill]` pops onto the lockup), then a payoff beat: a stepped bottom `[subtitle rail]`, a big `[count-up stat]` over a faint asset grid, or the lockup clears and a `[product UI window]` scales in. Static frame, all element-level.
- CTA (from text-clears-mark-blooms-lockup): the text-clear BLOOM — centered `[serif tagline]` beats (word-by-word staggered fades) hold, then CLEAR themselves to a blank frame; the `[brand mark]` spring-blooms from ZERO at dead center, slides left as the `[wordmark]` reveals to its right, and the balanced lockup holds (near-)still. Constant warm flat bg, static frame.
- Brand_Outro (from phrase-morphs-into-lockup): the MORPH chain — a centered `[phrase]` mutates in place, then collapses / swaps into an `[intermediate glyph]` whose line panels fan-and-flip around a central pivot with visible motion blur (page-flip feel) and interlock into the `[geometric mark]`, which slides apart into the lockup. One unbroken chain of transformation, never a cut-and-replace assembly; the finished lockup holds dead static for the final ~40–50% of runtime.
- Brand_Outro (from lead-text-then-mark-assembles): the parts-arrive build — a `[hand-off line]` holds and departs, then the mark is BUILT from arriving parts (`[icon]` drops in, letters slide in one by one, terminal punctuation lands, a confetti burst pops and instantly shrinks) OR a `[pixel stack]` streaks into full-width multicolor stripes whose tail retracts and is ABSORBED into the pixel mark — finishing as a lockup or a full end card (`[icon tile]` + `[title]` + `[URL pill]` + store badges) held static.
- Brand_Outro (from `settled-lockup-reveal`): the null-assembly boundary — the `[lockup]` is on stage from frame one; `[satellite shapes]` drift outward and fade, an accent underline sweeps beneath the wordmark, and the `[tagline]` wipes in to complete it. Settle-and-reveal: no predecessor beat, no morph, no relay.

**duration**: ~4.4–11.0s (Brand_Outro ~4.4–7.3s · brand-reveal ~5s · CTA text-clear bloom 6.0–8.9s · Product_Intro ~7s orbit sting, 7.0–9.8s parts-assembly · CTA push/build 5.4–11.0s)

**shot structure** (one consolidated time-coded template; `[slots]` are product-agnostic)

- Scene 1 — clear / ignite (0.0–~1.0s): the stage is prepared for the mark to build into.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: opens on a clean `[light bg]` with faint concentric guide rings under a flat top-down view; rings PULSE and expand from center; mid-beat the bg crossfades `[light]→[dark gradient: hero→secondary]`, tiny seed dots appear along the rings, and the central `[logo mark]`'s glow IGNITES (mark is present from t=0, fixed, front-facing).
  - _Variant — CTA push_: on a `[bg gradient]`, the `[logo mark]` is settling in object space (a 3D mark with thin wireframe edge-guides + a faint bracket motif behind center); a very slow continuous camera push-in may already be creeping.
  - _Variant — CTA button-build_: on a `[dark grid bg]`, a rounded `[CTA button "label"]` pill rises / scales into center (a prior headline clearing off the top); its thin border DRAWS ON as an animated glowing outline STROKE, with a small `[accent]` comet / spark icon at its left edge.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: a PRE-ARRANGED formation of `[feature pills / element grid]` (each `[icon]`+`[label]`) DISPERSES — elements slide outward from their laid-out positions and fly off all four frame edges (edge-clearing drift, NOT a center-origin burst), emptying the frame onto a clean `[bg]`.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro parts-assembly_ (from logo-parts-lockup-assembly): optional text hook — a centered "`[Meet product]`" line wipes away right→left — or straight into the build; on a flat / gradient `[bg]`, the first `[icon parts]` arrive: a glowing dot traces a clockwise circle, a gradient semi-circle scales up inside it, or the mark scales-up-with-rotate into center.
  - _Variant — CTA text-clear bloom_ (from text-clears-mark-blooms-lockup): a centered `[serif tagline / question]` (± an outlined `[badge pill]`) finishes a left→right word-staggered reveal in the first ~0.5–1s (each word passing light-grey→dark) and HOLDS; optional rolling word-by-word swap to a second `[availability line]`. Then the CLEAR: text exits — shrink-toward-center + fade, or word-by-word left-first fade-out — leaving a blank frame for a beat.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro morph-chain_ (from phrase-morphs-into-lockup): a centered `[phrase]` completes or mutates in place (a vertical slot-machine word swap — one word exits up as its replacement rises from below, rest of the line fixed — or a word-by-word landing) and holds. Nothing clears: the phrase IS the raw material for the mark.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro parts-arrive_ (from lead-text-then-mark-assembles): a centered `[hand-off line: tagline / "Brought to you by"]` holds on a flat canvas, then exits — slides straight down off-frame with fade, or fades away behind the incoming flourish.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro settled-reveal_ (from settled-lockup-reveal): the `[lockup]` is already centered at t=0; `[satellite shapes]` drift slowly outward around it — an INVERTED clear: the decorations leave, the mark stays.

- Scene 2 — assemble the mark (~1.0–~Ys): the mark builds itself from parts.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro_: seed dots SCALE UP into flat `[accent]` shapes arranged on the rings; concentric bands ripple outward (tunneling feel) and the shapes begin to ORBIT / drift around the still-fixed center.
  - _Variant — CTA push_: the `[wordmark]` CASCADES out from behind the mark (letters left→right with overshoot) into the full `[brand lockup]`; the 3D mark may assemble in beats (a terminal detaches + pops as a spring dot, a part hinges-open-and-snaps-shut elastic). Optional beat: a `[cursor]` arcs in and "clicks" the wordmark, OR a frosted-glass pill holding an intermediate `[CTA line]` springs in while layered mark shells fan to the edges.
  - _Variant — CTA button-build_: a graphic WIPE flips the frame to `[contrast bg]` — a thin `[accent]` diagonal line sweeps in, swells into a full-frame diagonal BAND, then collapses to a small `[accent]` slash.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: on the now-clear frame, the `[logo mark]` DRAWS ON via stroke (built arc-by-arc / segment-by-segment).
  - _Variant — Product_Intro parts-assembly_: the overlapping parts COMPLETE the `[brand icon]` (a second circle overlaps to close the orb; strokes interlock); the `[wordmark]` slides out from behind the icon or in from its right; a small `[badge pill]` pops onto the lockup.
  - _Variant — CTA text-clear bloom_: on the blank frame the `[brand mark]` scales up from ZERO at dead center with a snappy spring ease (slight overshoot, hint of rotation as it grows) — the whole mark at once, no parts.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro morph-chain_: the phrase collapses / wipes horizontally into the mark, OR is instantly swapped at the same center for a line-art `[intermediate icon]` whose strokes split into panels that fan-and-flip around a central pivot with visible motion blur, interlock-settling into the `[geometric mark]`. Never a cut to the finished logo — the transformation must stay unbroken.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro parts-arrive_: the mark is BUILT from arriving parts — the `[icon]` drops in from above, letters slide in one by one, terminal punctuation lands, a tiny confetti burst pops and instantly shrinks — OR a colored `[pixel stack]` pops in at a text edge, shoots horizontally stretching into full-width multicolor stripes, then the stripe tail retracts and is ABSORBED into the `[pixel mark]` (mask retraction).
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro settled-reveal_: an accent underline sweeps left→right beneath the `[wordmark]` — the only "build" this variant performs.

- Scene 3 — resolve to lockup (~Ys–end): the lockup completes and holds (Product_Intro / Brand_Outro) or is flown into / extended to a CTA (CTA variants).
  - _Variant — Product_Intro (the ONE camera move)_: the whole system smoothly TILTS from flat top-down into an angled isometric perspective (ease-in-out) with a slight zoom-out — flat shapes become luminous 3D forms, bands become glowing orbit lines, while the central `[logo mark]` does NOT tilt (stays 2D, front-facing, fixed). Camera eases to a stop; elements keep continuous orbit/drift (inner faster than outer); the mark holds its steady glow. Final settled frame.
  - _Variant — CTA push (the signature)_: a single fast CAMERA PUSH-THROUGH the mark's negative space / through the glass pill — heavy horizontal motion-blur, giant `[CTA]` letters streaking past the lens (cursor drops out). Resolves to the final lockup on a saturated `[bg]`: a `[url badge]` / `[CTA line]` revealed by a left→right WIPE carrying an `[accent]` leading edge (or a clean fade), with solid mark-shapes parallax-sliding in behind. Settles to a dead-static hold (slow zoom-out / settle).
  - _Variant — CTA button-build_: the `[wordmark]` BUILDS letter-by-letter to the right of the slash, landing on the final "`[slash] [WORDMARK]`" lockup centered on the new bg. Slow settle to static.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro_: the `[wordmark]` reveals beside the drawn mark (slide / fade) to complete the `[lockup]`; the lockup holds, then fades to `[black / bg]`.
  - _Variant — Product_Intro parts-assembly (the payoff beat)_: the finished lockup holds while a bottom `[subtitle box]` steps through `[tagline fragments]` (swap-in-place); or a big `[count-up stat]` line lands over a faint background asset grid; or the lockup scales-down / fades and a `[product UI window]` scales up on the flat bg (its panel content may swap once). The build hands off to product proof.
  - _Variant — CTA text-clear bloom_: the mark slides a short distance LEFT while the `[wordmark]` reveals to its right (letter-by-letter / slide-out wipe with visible partial states); the balanced "`[mark] + [wordmark]`" lockup centers and holds, one member continuing an almost imperceptible slow scale-up through the hold.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro morph-chain_: the mark slides left as the `[wordmark]` is pulled out rightward trailing a motion-blur streak, the pair decelerating into the centered lockup (± a `[sub-line]` fades in below). The hold is LONG — dead static for the final ~40–50% of runtime.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro parts-arrive_: the lockup rests centered and holds; or the full end card completes — a rounded-square `[icon tile]` scales up behind the mark, the `[title]` fades in word-by-word, and a bottom row (`[URL pill]` + `[store badges]`) fades / slides up — then holds static.
  - _Variant — Brand_Outro settled-reveal_: the `[tagline]` reveals left→right below the wordmark; the satellites finish drifting out and fade; the lockup holds centered (at most a very slow global zoom-out, no pan).

**motion vocabulary**: ring pulse / expand; background crossfade (light→dark); glow ignite; seed-dot scale-up; continuous orbit / drift (inner faster than outer); single 3D perspective tilt (flat→isometric) + slight zoom-out around a fixed 2D anchor; 3D logo assemble (part detach + spring dot, clapperboard hinge / snap, shell fan-out); wordmark cascade with overshoot (letters left→right); button pill rise / scale-in; animated stroke-outline DRAW + glow (button border AND logo mark); comet / spark accent; diagonal-band wipe (sweep → swell → collapse-to-slash); letter-by-letter wordmark build; pre-formed grid DISPERSE off all four edges; logo-mark stroke-draw (sequential arcs / segments); fast CAMERA PUSH-THROUGH with motion-blur (CTA spine); continuous slow push-in / push-out; cursor arc-in + click; parallax shape slide-in; left→right URL/badge wipe with glowing leading edge; static / fade-out end-lockup hold; optional idle breathe on the held mark; glowing-dot circular path trace; part-overlap icon completion (semi-circles scale up + overlap); scale-up-with-rotate mark entrance; wordmark slide-out-from-behind-icon; badge pill pop onto the lockup; stepped subtitle swap-in-place (bottom rail); count-up stat tick over a faint asset grid; lockup shrink / fade → UI-window scale-up payoff; word-by-word staggered fade-through-grey (in, and left-first out); rolling word-by-word line swap; shrink-toward-center + fade clearing exit; whole-mark spring BLOOM from zero (overshoot + slight rotation); near-imperceptible continuous scale-up through the hold; vertical slot-machine word swap; horizontal phrase collapse / wipe into the mark; instant same-center text→icon swap; line-panel fan-and-flip morph around a central pivot with motion blur (page-flip feel); interlock-settle into the geometric mark; wordmark pull-out trailing a motion-blur streak; lead-line slide-down-off-bottom exit; icon drop-in from above; sequential per-letter slide-in + terminal punctuation landing; confetti burst pop-then-instant-shrink; pixel-stack pop at a text edge; horizontal streak-stretch into full-width stripes; stripe-tail retraction absorbed into the mark (mask retraction); rounded-tile scale-up enclosing the mark; bottom metadata row fade / slide-up (URL pill + store badges); satellite shapes outward drift + fade; left→right underline sweep; left→right tagline wipe-in.

**rule mapping** (per motion verb → `rules/<id>.md`)

- ring pulse / expand from center → `center-outward-expansion` (radiate from a shared center; reuse the 0→1 progress driver)
- background crossfade (light→dark gradient) → plain opacity/background tween via `gsap-effects` (no dedicated rule needed)
- glow ignite on the mark → `asr-keyword-glow` (envelope-driven glow on the brand element)
- seed-dot scale-up into shapes → `spring-pop-entrance` (scale-in pop; alt `scale-swap-transition` if dots morph into shapes)
- continuous orbit / drift around fixed center → `orbit-3d-entry` (flip-in then continuous elliptical orbit; center label = the fixed mark)
- single 3D perspective tilt (flat→isometric) + slight zoom-out → `multi-phase-camera` (scripted scale phases on a scene-wrapping camera, for the zoom-out) — see camera modifier; the FLAT→ISOMETRIC plane tilt of the whole stage is a CSS-3D perspective move (`techniques.md` CSS-3D, animating the stage's `rotateX`) — no exact camera rule for the plane-tilt, approximate via CSS-3D (closest reference is `orbit-3d-entry`'s "Tilted orbit plane" variation animated over time)
- fixed 2D anchor logo amid moving universe → no motion rule needed (static anchor; intentional — it's the absence of motion, the universe moves around it)
- 3D logo assemble — part detach + spring dot → `spring-pop-entrance` (spring pop, `back.out` overshoot)
- 3D logo assemble — hinge open / snap (clapperboard) → `hacker-flip-3d` (the 3D-rotate axis) + `techniques.md` CSS-3D (the elastic open-and-snap-shut hinge is an adaptation of the 3D-rotate)
- 3D logo assemble — shell fan-out to edges → `center-outward-expansion` (run outward from the mark center)
- wordmark cascade with overshoot (letters left→right) → recipe `gsap-effects` (per-element staggered slide) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the `back.out` overshoot per letter)
- button pill rise / scale-in → `spring-pop-entrance` (scale-in; alt `scale-swap-transition`)
- animated stroke-outline draw + glow (button border) → `svg-path-draw` (stroke-dashoffset draw) + `asr-keyword-glow` (the glow on the drawn stroke)
- comet / spark accent on button → `asr-keyword-glow` (small glow accent); motion path via `techniques.md` GSAP MotionPathPlugin (#9)
- diagonal-band wipe (sweep → swell → collapse-to-slash) → `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12, animate a `polygon(...)` diagonal across the frame; the swell-then-collapse-to-slash is the same clip-path reveal driven through grow→shrink keyframes)
- letter-by-letter wordmark build → `discrete-text-sequence` (smooth-slice / per-state build); recipe `gsap-effects` (typewriter / appending words)
- pre-formed grid disperse off all four edges → not a rule gap: a formation flying off-frame is an EXIT, and the pipeline forbids mid-video exits — the harness transition IS the exit (only the final frame may exit the stage). Treat this as transition-handled / final-frame-only rather than an in-scene motion rule. (If staged in-scene as a reveal-the-mark clear, it reuses `center-outward-expansion` run OUTWARD — center→target machinery interpolating formation→offscreen targets, out-easing.)
- logo-mark stroke-draw (sequential arcs / segments) → `svg-path-draw` (the canonical multi-segment stagger draw)
- wordmark slide / fade reveal beside drawn mark → `svg-path-draw` (its "brand-line fades in after stroke" tail) ; slide via `spring-pop-entrance`
- fast camera push-through with motion-blur → `multi-phase-camera` (a hard push phase) — see camera modifier; the heavy motion-blur streak itself → `motion-blur-streak` (directional velocity blur on the fast push-through)
- continuous slow push-in / push-out → `multi-phase-camera` (phase scale + drift)
- cursor arc-in + click on the wordmark → `cursor-click-ripple` (move → click → ripple); arc path via `techniques.md` MotionPathPlugin (#9)
- parallax shape slide-in behind lockup → `depth-scatter-assemble` (parallax depth slide-in of shapes at differing depths; pair with `3d-text-depth-layers` for the depth ordering)
- left→right URL / badge wipe with glowing leading edge → `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12, animate `inset()` left→right); the glowing leading edge → `asr-keyword-glow`
- static / fade-out end-lockup hold → no motion rule needed (terminal hold / opacity fade; intentional)
- idle breathe on held mark (optional) → `sine-wave-loop` (post-settle breathing)
- glowing-dot circular path trace → `svg-path-draw` (the traced circle draws on) + `techniques.md` MotionPathPlugin (#9) for the leading dot riding the path tip
- part-overlap icon completion / semi-circle scale-up → `spring-pop-entrance` (per-part scale-in; place parts at their final overlap positions from setup — the overlap IS the completed mark)
- scale-up-with-rotate mark entrance → `spring-pop-entrance` (add a rotation from-value to the pop)
- wordmark slide-out-from-behind-icon → recipe `gsap-effects` (x-slide) under a clip / overflow mask via `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12); z-order the icon above the sliding text
- badge pill pop onto the lockup → `spring-pop-entrance`
- stepped subtitle swap-in-place (bottom rail) → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-state replacement at time thresholds); derive the windows via `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- count-up stat tick over a faint asset grid → `counting-dynamic-scale`; the faint grid is a plain opacity fade (no rule needed)
- lockup shrink / fade → UI-window payoff → `scale-swap-transition` (exit cluster shrinks + fades at center; window pops in with `back.out`)
- word-by-word staggered fade-through-grey (in / left-first out) → recipe `gsap-effects` (per-word staggered opacity + color tween). Deliberately a quiet FADE register — do NOT substitute `waterfall-entry` here; its binary-arrival doctrine is the wrong voice for this serif beat
- rolling word-by-word line swap → two overlapping `gsap-effects` word staggers at the same timeline position (old line out left-first, new line in left→right)
- shrink-toward-center + fade clearing exit → `scale-swap-transition` (its exit half; the entrance half is the bloom)
- whole-mark spring BLOOM from zero → `spring-pop-entrance` (single hero, `back.out` overshoot, slight rotation from-value)
- near-imperceptible continuous scale-up through the hold → no motion rule needed (one long linear micro-tween on the held lockup; intentional life-in-the-hold)
- vertical slot-machine word swap → `vertical-spring-ticker` (masked column, stepped tween — one word slot cycles, rest of the line fixed)
- horizontal phrase collapse / wipe into the mark → `scale-swap-transition` (same-center morph) with the collapse via `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12)
- instant same-center text→icon swap → no motion rule needed (`tl.set` hard swap; intentional — the chain's continuity lives in the NEXT beat's morph)
- line-panel fan-and-flip morph (page-flip, motion-blurred) → `hacker-flip-3d` (the per-panel 3D rotation axis) + `motion-blur-streak` (the blur) + `techniques.md` CSS-3D; true stroke-interpolation glyph morphs live in `hyperframes-keyframes` (SVG morph) — reach there if panels can't sell it
- interlock-settle into the geometric mark → `center-outward-expansion` machinery run INWARD (per-panel transform offsets tween to 0 in lockstep with one driver)
- wordmark pull-out trailing a motion-blur streak → `motion-blur-streak` (echo / ghost trail collapsing into the lead) on the x-slide
- lead-line slide-down-off-bottom exit → in-scene clearing beat; same doctrine as the grid-disperse row above (offscreen target + out-easing; prefer the harness transition when the exit IS the scene boundary)
- icon drop-in from above → `spring-pop-entrance` (y-offset from-value, overshoot on landing)
- sequential per-letter slide-in + terminal punctuation landing → `waterfall-entry` (staggered arrival cascade on a lateral axis; the punctuation is the cascade's final, heaviest beat)
- confetti burst pop-then-instant-shrink → `press-release-spring` ("release burst" variation) for a small deterministic burst; a true multi-particle confetti field → `particle-burst`
- pixel-stack pop at a text edge → `spring-pop-entrance` (tight stagger down the stack)
- horizontal streak-stretch into full-width stripes → plain `scaleX` stretch via `gsap-effects` (transform-origin at the stack) + `motion-blur-streak` for the streak read
- stripe-tail retraction absorbed into the mark → `techniques.md` clip-path reveal (#12) run in REVERSE (animated `inset()` retraction reading as mask absorption into the mark)
- rounded-tile scale-up enclosing the mark → `spring-pop-entrance` (scale-in BEHIND the mark; z-order only, mark never moves)
- bottom metadata row fade / slide-up → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group, ≤500ms cap)
- satellite shapes outward drift + fade → `center-outward-expansion` run OUTWARD (drift targets past frame edge) + opacity tail; if the drift must idle first, seed it with `sine-wave-loop`
- left→right underline sweep → `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep re-skinned as an underline) or `stat-bars-and-fills` progress-fill `scaleX`
- left→right tagline wipe-in → the existing "left→right URL / badge wipe" row applies unchanged (clip-path `inset()`)

**camera modifier** (the push / tilt)

- **CTA push-through** (the CTA spine): a scripted hard zoom phase on a scene-wrapping camera → `multi-phase-camera` ("Steady push" / "Bookend pull" pattern; push phase = the climax). When the mark is OFF-center and the camera must fly through a specific point of negative space, combine with `coordinate-target-zoom` (outer scales, inner counter-translates so the target negative-space point lands at viewport center as scale ramps; measure the offset at setup). The signature heavy horizontal MOTION-BLUR on the streak → `motion-blur-streak` (directional velocity blur on the push); realize with a CSS `filter: blur()` / duplicated-streak layer on the camera during the push window.
- **Product_Intro tilt** (the one cinematic move): the flat→isometric perspective tilt + slight zoom-out is a single scripted camera beat → `multi-phase-camera` (scale phase + the "Targeted zoom into off-center element" / drift machinery) for the zoom-out. `multi-phase-camera` is scale+translate+drift only, so the perspective-PLANE rotateX (flat top-down → angled isometric) of the whole stage is the CSS-3D move noted above — approximate via `techniques.md` CSS-3D, animating the stage's `rotateX` (closest reference is `orbit-3d-entry`'s "Tilted orbit plane" variation animated over time).
- **Static-frame variants**: the parts-assembly, text-clear bloom, morph-chain, parts-arrive, and settled-reveal variants are all COMPLETELY static-frame (element-level motion only; settled-reveal tolerates at most a very slow global zoom-out). The camera modifier applies only to the CTA push and the Product_Intro tilt.

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Values

| token         | range                 | notes                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BASE_DURATION | 0.6–1.5s              | minimum per entry regardless of length — even one-word entries get read time                                          |
| SEC_PER_CHAR  | 0.03–0.06 s/char      | ≈17–33 chars/sec; uniform across the sequence so the pace reads as one engine; lean high for wide-character languages |
| HOLD_MID      | 0.5–1.0s              | dwell on a non-final entry; `< HOLD_FINAL`                                                                            |
| HOLD_FINAL    | 1.0–2.0s              | climax dwell — must exceed HOLD_MID by a clear margin so the close reads as a beat                                    |
| SPEED_FACTOR  | 0.5–2.0 (default 1.0) | per-entry only; if every entry shares a factor, fold it into SEC_PER_CHAR                                             |
| TAIL_PAD      | 0.0–1.0s              | quiet beat after the last entry; prefer 0 when the next composition owns the breath                                   |
| CONTENT N     | 3–6 entries           | <3 isn't a sequence; >6 drags (accelerating cadence relaxes this — see above)                                         |

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**
