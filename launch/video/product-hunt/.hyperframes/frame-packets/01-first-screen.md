## Frame 1 — The first screen

- scene: A polished generated app gives way to the unresolved question of what happens after prompt one.
- duration: 5s
- poster: 2.6s
- transition_in: cut
- status: outline
- voiceover: "AI app builders can create an impressive first screen. The difficult part is turning it into a product that still works after the next five prompts."
- src: compositions/frames/01-first-screen.html
- type: hook
- blueprint: video-text-pivot
- asset_candidates: assets/demos/fieldflow-demo.mp4, assets/product-stills/fieldflow-app-updated.png

Open cold on the familiar win, then reframe it as the beginning rather than the finish. The second title lands as the product footage recedes into an unresolved follow-up surface. No competitor UI appears.

- focal: assets/demos/fieldflow-demo.mp4
- roles: fieldflow-demo = cutout · fieldflow-app-updated = supporting
- sfx: low-air-hit

Adapt `video-text-pivot`: keep the real video-to-type weight transfer; replace the prohibited invented hero metric with the verified editorial contrast between first screen and finished product.
Scene 1 (0.0–2.2s): FieldFlow runs in a large centered product window; “The first screen is becoming easy.” reveals above it in two chunks while the app remains the visual proof.
Scene 2 (2.2–3.6s): the product window slides left and scales down at the same anchor as a focused follow-up prompt enters right; the handoff preserves the blueprint's signature weight transfer (`scale-swap-transition`).
Scene 3 (3.6–5.0s): both yield to “Finishing the product is not.” in near-black display type with “not” underlined blue; the line holds still into the cut.

## Selected blueprint: video-text-pivot

# video-text-pivot — Video → Text Pivot

**intent**: A product video holds center and claims attention, then slides aside to hand its weight to a hero stat in the space it vacates, then both clear and kinetic text types into the center — accent words carrying the meaning the video used to carry — sealed by a gradient pill. The arc is "show → yield → pivot → stamp," and each handoff pairs an exit with a same-anchor entrance so two beats read, not four.

**roles served**

- Product_Intro (from `metric-video-text-pivot`): when the open is "see the feature" then "see the impact" and the `[product video]` must stay visible through the stat reveal — it slides, it doesn't cut.
- Key_Feature: a feature clip that yields to a frame-filling metric and a typographic impact line.

**duration**: 6–8s

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas; one `[product video]` as a real muted `.mp4` clip, a hero stat, then kinetic text — each pair shares a screen anchor so the handoff reads as a weight-transfer)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.6s) — the video shows.** The `[product video]` lands centered on a smooth scale-up and breathes (a small y-bob), claiming full attention. Camera static.
- **Scene 2 (~1.6–3.2s) — yield + stat (signature move).** The video SLIDES aside (x + scale down) **into the very space** the `[hero stat]` now fills as the stat pops in with 3D-depth type — one weight-transfer reading as a single event, not two. The stat breathes within this window.
- **Scene 3 (~3.2–5.0s) — pivot to text.** Both video and stat clear out and kinetic `[impact text]` TYPES into the vacated center, character by character; its `[accent words]` carry the meaning the video used to carry.
- **Scene 4 (~5.0–end) — stamp.** A gradient `[pill]` snaps shut around the closing line (`scaleX` 0→1), its glow halo resolving a beat behind so the silhouette reads before the bloom — sealing the statement as one graphic. Holds.

**motion vocabulary**: video scale-in + small breath; weight-transfer slide (video x + scale-down handing off to the stat at the same anchor); 3D-depth stat type; character-stream typing; gradient pill scaleX-snap; glow-halo bloom trailing the silhouette.

**rule mapping**

- video entrance (smooth) and the weight-transfer slide → `gsap-effects` (scale/opacity then x + scale on a long-tail `power3`); the video itself is a muted `<video class="clip">` direct child of the root
- hero stat's frame-filling 3D type → `3d-text-depth-layers` (static-depth variation — layers built at setup, no cascade fighting the entry)
- the same-anchor video-exit ↔ stat-entry handoff (if treated as a morph) → `scale-swap-transition` (shared center)
- character-by-character impact typing through segmented spans → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (clean character stream) or `discrete-text-sequence`
- pill `scaleX` snap + trailing glow halo → `gsap-effects` (scaleX) + `ambient-glow-bloom` (the halo, resolving a beat behind)
- video / stat breath within their windows → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude register — subtle jitter, gated to each element's window, never a forever loop)

**camera modifier**: camera-static — all motion is element-space (the video translates), so the "pivot" is the elements moving, not a camera.

## Selected motion rule: scale-swap-transition

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.
